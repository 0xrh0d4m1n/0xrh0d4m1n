## :thought_balloon: **A Quote**

> Freedom is a voyage steered by the compass of knowledge and the sails of persistence, a transformative journey that requires humility and willingness. I believe that sailing this way, it is possible to anchor and rest in the safe harbor of our true potential. The digital world is our battleground, and knowledge is our self-defense weapon. – 0xrh0d4m1n
